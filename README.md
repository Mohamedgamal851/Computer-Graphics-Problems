# Computer-Graphics-Problems
This collection is dedicated to exploring and solving various problems and challenges in the field of computer graphics. 

## **1- Drawing Line Using Simple DDA Algorithm**
## **2- Draing Triangle Using Bresenham(Mid Point) Algorithm**
## **3- Drawing A Circle Face Using Bresenham(Mid Point) Algorithm**
## **4- Drawing A Number 8 Using midpoint circle drawing algorithm and the flood fill filling algorithm **
###  1- Create window application program
###  2- Change the width of window to 1200 and height to 1200 
###  3- Change the window background to black 
###  4- Change the starting points (x , y) of window  to (15,15)
###  4- Take 1 point from user by using mouse handling .
###  5- Draw number (8) in English by using the entered point, where this point represents the center of the circle that represents the first part/half of the 8 number. 
###  6- Make the radius of the circle as preconfigured with value: 50 and use the midpoint circle drawing algorithm and the flood fill filling algorithm to draw the 8 number and fill it with white color.
## **5- 3D OpenGL Project**
Requirements:

### 1. Draw a 3D Scene that contains the following objects:

### a. 3D building at least 2 floors, a roof, one door and four windows.
### b. 3D Bicycle.
### 2. Apply the following color models

### a. Apply suitable colors to each object in building
### b. Change background to green.
### c. Apply black color to 3D Bicycle

### 3. Apply the following transformations on the building:
### a. Use key ‘o’ to open the door with suitable angle.
### b. Use key ‘c’ to close the door with suitable angle.
### c. Use key ‘O’ to open the windows with suitable angle.
### d. Use key ‘C’ to close the windows with suitable angle.

### 4. Apply the following transformations on the bicycle:

### a. Use key ‘f’ to move the bicycle forward in X-axis direction.
### b. Use key ‘b’ to move the bicycle backward in X-axis
### direction.
### c. Use key ‘r’ to rotate right wheel with suitable angle.
### d. Use key ‘l’ to rotate left wheel with suitable angle.
### 5. Move the bicycle in a circular street that surrounds the building in
### automatic manner.

### a. Use the mouse left button to enable animation so that the bicycle
### starts rotating around the building.
### b. Use the mouse right button to disable animation.

### 6. 
### a. Control camera coordinates to see 3D scene from different directions
